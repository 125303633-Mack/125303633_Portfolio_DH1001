<h2>
    Anatomy of an AI System
</h2>
<p>
    <blockquote>
        I found this article to be very eye opening into the methods and practices behind ai systems like the amazon echo and Alexa. Before reading this, I had no 
        concept of the true extent of what goes into creating and running these ai systems and how harmful they can be to both the Earth and ourselves. I found it 
        fascinating how the ways in which a simple question being asked to one of these systems has ,hidden behind it, an incredibly large cost of operation both in
        the exploitation of human labour and the extraction of valuable materials from the Earth itself. Going about your average day you wouldn't think of  
        these costs. I think we are too used to the convenience that this technology provides to us in our everyday lives. There are so many ways that the small but powerful and wealthy 
        group at the top exploit everyday people. I think this is a major issue and has been for a very long time. This article expresses the issue of 
        class division and how negative the impacts are. How oblivious most of us are to this issue.

<h2>
    The Internet's Own Boy 
</h2>
<p>
    <blockquote>
        Before watching this documentary, I had never heard of Aaron Swartz and everything that he had accomplished in giving all of us access to an open internet. 
        I never really thought too deeply about what efforts it took people like Aaron to give us the level of access and the freedom of use of information that we have 
        today and that we take for granted. The greed of companies mentioned like JSTOR is unimaginable. Aaron's selflessness was incredibly important to our online 
        freedoms today. His unwillingness to bow down under a broken and corrupt system should be celebrated by everyone who uses the internet. People like him are 
        important in pushing the needle and helping to improve things. I found it frustrating but not surprising the lengths that the government and people in power 
        went to try and stop him. It's incredibly unfortunate and unjust that the people in power, focused on maintaining their position at the top, pushed him down the 
        path he ended up going.

<h2>
    Social Media and the Web - Principles within "a contract for the web"
</h2>
<p>
    <blockquote>
        The points Eli Pariser makes in his TED talk were and still are incredibly important for a fair, free and accessible web.  Even though the talk was released
        in 2011 we unfortunately still encounter the same systems and algorithms that are embedded in search engines and social media. Arguably it has become worse 
        since then. With the more singular ownership over multiple social media platforms like Meta has with Facebook, WhatsApp etc... and Twitter being bought by 
        Elon Musk there's more of a chance of people finding themselves lost in filter bubbles.<br><br>

        Both principle's 5 and 8 should be fundamental pillars of a free and accessible web. I believe that they go hand in hand with one another. 
        A strong community should be built on trust and respect by both other users and companies. Our data is now a commodity that can be taken and sold when there 
        should be a clear and accessible way of knowing what information you're giving up and who can access it. This lack of trust is a major issue between the user
        and large companies.<br><br>

        Principle 8 is lifted up with the help of principle 5. Trust is important for everyone to feel safer online. Like the point mentioned in Pariser's talk 
        there is a problem with accessibility and availability of the internet for some groups. There should be equal access to something that has become such an 
        important tool in the modern day. To prevent access and availability to the internet is to cut someone off from a global online community.

<h2>
    Should all archives be Open Access?
</h2>
<p>
    <blockquote>
        Rev's article brings up a lot of interesting points for both sides of the argument. From issues with having the full context of a document due to redactions of
        important figures to sensitive data being leaked because of too many places online holding information for hackers to easily access. I think it's a difficult 
        argument to choose a side for. To me it feels like there needs to be a middle ground with what information can be open access. I lean more to believing
        that archives should be open access but with respect to people's privacy that want it protected. I know that would be difficult to determine for everyone 
        mentioned. There are issues today online with companies taking absorbent amounts of data. With the rise of AI, it will most likely be even more difficult to 
        protect their private data. There are advantages and disadvantages to both, open access giving more people access to information, broader historical context, 
        known government actions vs privacy/ safety concerns and censorship.

    Where might the Internet of Sounds go from here?
</h2>
<p>
    <blockquote>
        After this introduction to the IoT and IoS I think that we'll only see more and more integration into everyday life. Even today a lot of things have embedded 
        systems in them that you might not think have them. The video in the introduction slides about workplace tracking and everything practically being on rails 
        unsettled me to be completely honest. That to me is a sort of obvious sign of the negative and dystopian side of these things. It's used today by amazon having complaints that 
        its too restrictive. Unfortunately I see that kind of system being used more in the future. It's interesting how people are using IoT and IoS for preserving 
        things. I hope that we get to see more examples like the Adria Rattle. Im intrigued to see even better methods used to preserve things and make them accessible to 
        more people. AI looks like it's going to play more of a role in this as we head into the future.

<h2>
    What is Artificial Intelligence? Is it actually intelligent?
</h2>
<p>
    <blockquote>
        I decided to read the Guardian article about the inventor of the first chatbot, Joseph Weizenbaum. After reading through the article i found it interesting that 
        the first chatbot Eliza and modern day ChatGPT etc. are very similar to each other. Eliza was designed to emit an illusion of understanding so that it could 
        'pass' as a real person, similar to the chatbots we have today. But what exactly is ai? It was mentioned in the article how Eliza was designed with a set of 
        rules to be able to return a plausible response and that something like ChatGPT is a large language model designed to mathematically predict what to say next. 
        Both models essentially follow the same idea of having their own set of rules to determine an outcome. Essentially designed to trick the person using it into 
        believing there is a kind of thought process rather than just information grabbing based on prediction.<br><br>

        The definition of intelligence from Oxford Languages is "The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills". I think that ai is intelligent in a different 
        way to our definition or, at least, has certain aspects of the definition. AI has the ability to acquire knowledge from every corner of the internet and apply 
        it to a response of a prompt given to it but doesn't have the ability to think, reason or truly understand what its being asked to do. It does things 
        automatically when prompted. It doesn't truly think or analyze but but predicts. Mentioned in the article was what Weizenbaum said about "intelligence existing 
        as a whole person, not just any one part" and that "intelligence isn't in the head but also the arm, wrist, hand." I think that ai today isn't truly/fully 
        intelligent as it lacks some of the most important fundamental aspects of intelligence. Towards the end of the article Weizenbaum spoke about ai being capable 
        of calculation but not judgement. A really interesting and i think important point was brought up about the idea that even if ai can do a task/ job, it 
        shouldn't be allowed to do certain jobs like acting as a judge or a therapist. For as far as ai has come in the modern day I don't think it is 'actually 
        intelligent'

<h2>
    What potential applications for VR, AR and XR do you envisage in future?
</h2>
<p>
    <blockquote>
        After getting to use a VR headset and getting to interact with some AR things in the past I think that we're just going to keep seeing more and more 
        implementation of these things in everyday life. The biggest example of this being VR/ AR glasses that you can buy today. I see education being benefited with 
        using VR etc. with the idea of making it more accessible in a lot of cases. The one downside of it that i can think of is the lack of touch. It would be 
        interesting with the something like haptic feedback or another thing similar to that to be an option in the future. Actually being able to manipulate things in 
        a virtual world and physically interact with them could be great for teaching and learning practical skills. It's a great tool to use to help train people for 
        certain jobs and make it easier to access that training. Places like museums could display a more interactive exhibit or model the exhibit into VR. I also see 
        the leisure side of VR growing with new headsets getting released every couple of years with more people getting access.
